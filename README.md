## Overview

This repo contains some templates for creating and executing a discrete choice experiment as a tool for teaching consumer theory. During the first couple of weeks in a typical Intermediate Microeconomics course, students are introduced to the concepts of consumer choice and preferences. But how do those relate to a demand curve? Using tired examples of goods that they can purchase at a store does a pretty poor job of mapping preferences to demand. The price of a soda from the store is just the price of the sodaâ€”if a person wants a soda at a given price, they will buy it (put yourself in the shoes of the student, preferences are still pretty foreign and closely related to having or not having money for something). Having students trace a demand curve for this type of "market" good is pretty boring (speaking from experience). Introducing the concept of "nonmarket" goods (i.e. things you cannot buy at the store) helps to abstract away from retail prices where people are simply facing given prices. Cue the discrete choice experiment! 

## Learning Outcomes

1. Consumer theory: choice, preferences, transitivity
2. Marginal utility and marginal rates of substitution
4. WTP curves and distributions

## Workflow

The general workflow goes as follows: 

- Introduce consumer theory and willingness to pay (WTP) curves
  - This should include derivation of marginal utility and marginal rates of substitution. Setting the stage for MWTP as the ratio of two preference parameters: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?MU_{x}/MU_{\$}" /> 
- Using the templates in this game: 
  - Randomly sssign an annual household income to students (a budget constraint that is not correlated with their current ramen budget)
  - Link students to the online choice experiment (I use Qualtrics, and the cleaning scripts are set up to clean data exported from Qualtrics)
  - Export and clean data
  - Run regressions that estimate MWTP
   - I do this in real time in class (it takes seconds to run) as it is also a good opportunity to introduce students to statistical software (after which many will come and ask for research assistant support, neat!) 

## Generate Incomes 

Generating incomes for your students can be done using the Stata script `1_generate_incomes.do`. Depending on which platform you use for your class (Blackboard, etc.), you will need to import your roster differently. I have provided an example roster `store\student_roster.xlsx`. This is a typical roster exported from Blackboard, but adjust as needed to your input data. This script randomly assigns incomes to students using a modified beta distribution (trying to mimic real-world income distributions, which makes for a fun side conversation). Some students are rich, some are poor. Their choices (and subsequent WTP) should reflect this. The script also generates the necessary contact information (email) and external data (income) that will be read by Qualtrics. 

- Input: `student_roster.xlsx`
- Output: `student_incomes.csv`

## Online Choice Experiement

Setting up the online choice experiment can be done at any time; however, when using Qualtrics, the `student_incomes.csv` file will be an input for the survey. As such, I have organized it to come second in this summary. The ordering and wording of the questions is outlined in `2_survey_questions.docx`. The introduction and post-survey questions are simply plain text. The choice questions themselves are in HTML and will call on the image of the choice question. For this example, I use AWS S3 as the host for the image, although this can be done using any hosting service. I have also included the file `survey.docx` where you can make changes to any piece of the survey, and export the pages as images. In turn, piping the new images (your new choice questions) into the qualtrics survey. 

One thing to note is that the choice experiment provided in this example is not an 'efficient' design. Meaning, the attributes are not orthogonal. This is intentional. I have incorporated two concepts into the choice cards: 1) transitivity, and 2) strictly dominated alternatives. This allows the instructor to test if students were paying attention (and call the ones out who clearly didn't... just kidding, maybe), but also to reiterate axioms of choice and how they are play out in the real world. 

### Transitivity

There are three scenarios in the survey that are the same across choice cards. This allows us to rank preferences such that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A\succsim%20B\succsim%20C" />. The bundles are not strictly dominated by any other and any combination of preference relations could be perfectly rational. However, we can test the students choices against the weak axiom of revealed preferences. This doesn't really matter other than to say something along the lines of "seven student's chocies were not consistent with preferences exhibiting the property of transitivity."

 ### Strictly Dominated Alternatives

Choice card number 3 includes the choice between scenario A and scenario B, where scenario B is strictly dominated by scenario A. It is perfectly rational for a student to choose "No Change" but the only policy scenario that would be rational is "Scenario A" as it includes attributes that are all more improved at a lower cost than "Scenario B". 

Moreover:
